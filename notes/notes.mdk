~ Abstract
There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West.
Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued
food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world!

# What is LSP?

LSP solves the dilemma that creators of (programming and specification)
languages face when it comes to tooling support for their language. 
Tooling providers (Visual Studio, Eclipse, ...) see no benefit in adding 
support for another (research) language until the language has reached 
maturity and attracted a significant user base. On the other hand, language 
creators usually do not have the bandwidth to add language support to all 
editors and IDEs out there. This limits the languages reach because the success
of a language is also determined by its tooling.

Providing a home-grown solution or focusing on a single IDE is the usual 
approach taken by language creators. LSP is a game changer because it provides
a standardized API that when used will work in all IDEs. 

# TLA+ or another language?     { #sec-intro }

Most asked-for feature (besides solving state space explosion) with regards to Tooling

## Obstacles

* Untyped, math-based, high-level makes Tooling generally more challenging
  * Impedance mismatch with programming IDEs
* TLA+ and/or PlusCal?
  * PlusCal uses TLA+ expressions
* LSP does not cover functionality available in TLA+ Toolbox for
  * model checking
    * => Embed HTML
    * => Text-based Model
  * proof assistant
    * decompose proof command
      * => Hack refactoring supoprt of LSP
* Current Toolbox and Tools implemented in Java
* Syntax and semantic checker (SANY) command-line only tool
  * Refactoring SANY a hackathon of its own
  * => Duplicate functionality? :-(

* Discussed what LSP is and what it can be used for
* Came up wit the following goals

# Goals (+) and Non-Goals (-)

* (+) Familiarize with LSP
* (+) Generic LSP to text-based stdin/stdout command-line interface, i.e. an LSP implementation that invokes the (existing) tools such as syntax checker, compiler, ... of the language via their existing command-line interfaces. In other words, the goal is a language-agnostic LSP implementation which can be - with little effort - connected to existing command-line tools.
  * Not bound to TLA+ but tailored to languages that just require a small subset of the features provided by LSP (mainly editing)
  * => Identify subset of functionality we want to support
  * => (-) Optimal performance not one of the main goals 
* (-) Do not build a product

# Action Items

* Daan: Jonathan Brachth√§user LSP for Koka
* Ken: Send GitHub username to Markus to get access to repo
* Leo: Send GitHub username to Markus to get access to repo
* Everybody: Read LSP documentation
